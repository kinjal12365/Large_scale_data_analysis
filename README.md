Sales Data Analytics Project

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a year's worth of sales data to extract meaningful insights that drive business decisions. The analysis involves data cleaning, feature engineering, outlier removal, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, and customer churn analysis.

📊 Key Objectives

Perform data cleaning to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicates.

Implement feature engineering to create new meaningful features.

Identify and remove outliers to ensure data quality.

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create insightful visualizations.

Perform RFM analysis to segment customers based on purchasing behavior.

Analyze customer churn, visualize trends, and provide business insights.

📂 Dataset

Source:  sales database (Excel format)

Data Duration: One year

🔄 Data Preprocessing

1️⃣ Data Cleaning

Removed duplicate entries

Handled missing values using imputation techniques

Standardized categorical values for consistency

2️⃣ Feature Engineering

Extracted new features such as Order_Week, Order_Month, Revenue_per_Customer

Created a customer tenure metric based on first purchase date

3️⃣ Outlier Detection & Removal

Used Z-score and IQR methods to detect and remove outliers in Sales_Amount and Quantity

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualizations

Sales trends over time using line charts

Revenue distribution across customer segments

Product category performance using bar charts

Monthly and seasonal sales analysis

Heatmaps to analyze correlations between numerical features

📌 RFM Analysis

Performed Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) segmentation to identify customer value:

Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase

Frequency: How often a customer makes a purchase

Monetary: Total spending of a customer

Customer Segments Identified:

High-Value Customers: Frequent buyers with high spending

At-Risk Customers: Previously active but haven’t purchased recently

Lost Customers: Haven’t purchased for a long time

New Customers: Recently onboarded customers

🔍 Insights from RFM Analysis:

High-value customers contribute 40% of revenue

At-risk customers need engagement strategies like discounts or emails

📉 Churn Analysis

Approach:

Defined churned customers as those who haven’t purchased in the last X months

Analyzed trends of churn over the year

Compared spending behavior of retained vs. churned customers

🔍 Key Insights:

Churn rate peaked in Q3 due to seasonal trends

Customers who engaged in holiday discounts had higher retention

VIP customers had a 20% lower churn rate due to loyalty programs

📌 Business Recommendations

Customer Retention Strategies: Implement targeted discounts and loyalty programs

Revenue Growth: Focus marketing efforts on high-value customers

Churn Reduction: Personalized re-engagement campaigns for at-risk customers

Inventory Optimization: Stock up high-demand products in peak seasons

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)

Jupyter Notebook (For scripting and visualization)

📢 Conclusion

This project provided actionable insights by leveraging EDA, RFM segmentation, and churn analysis. The findings highlight customer behavior patterns and areas where the business can optimize its strategies for revenue growth and retention.

📌 Next Steps: Deploy a real-time dashboard for ongoing sales monitoring.
